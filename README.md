Blog posts, forum posts and news articles usually have a comments section.

This project was created using Svelte 5, and demonstrates a 'comment section'; a series of recursive, nested comments, and their replies, and _their_ replies (and so forth).

To accomplish this, import the code in itself, ie, in the code Comments.svelte, add:

import Comments from '$lib/Components/Comments.svelte'

Then invoke it later in the code as appropriate:

<Comments {blog}>

This:
```

Comment 1
  Reply 1
    Sub Reply 1    
    Sub Reply 2
  Reply 2
Comment 2

```
is generated with this:

```

{#if blog.replies && showReplies}
  {#each blog.replies as blog}
    <div style="margin-left: {indent};">   
      <Comments {blog}>
    </div>
  {/each}
{/if}

```

The key concept here is that the 'replies' blog property (an array) has its own 'replies' property (again, an array) as a member.

So, if a reply has more replies under it (ie, a non-empty replies array), the component

<Comments {blog}Â />

is invoked until there are no more nested replies.

Take careful note of the 'blog.replies' array in the preceeding code and 'replies' array in the following schema. If non-empty, recursion occurs.
```

testBlogs = [{
  "userid": 1,
  "username": "Wilma",
  "title": "'Blog' from Wilma",  
  "entry": "Blog entry...",
  "likes":0,
  "dislikes":0,
  "replies": [
    {
      "userid": 2
      "username": "Gordo",
      "entry": "comment 1",
      "likes": 0,
      "dislikes": 0,
      "replies": [],
    }
  ],
}]

```

The 'Add Item' button just adds another item (blog, in this case) to the list of 'commentable items'.

The backend uses zod validation and MongoDB (Mongoose) for the database.  The Documentation on the website (see the nav bar) gives further details.


To try this out, download/clone the project, go into that folder, type 'npm install'\
Then, go into Visual Code, open a terminal, and type 'npm run dev'
